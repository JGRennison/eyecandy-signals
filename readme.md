# WenSim's Eyecandy Signals

A GRF that adds signals as eyecandy objects.

## Building

This GRF requires [JGR's patched version of NML](https://github.com/jgrennison/nml). You can download it either via `just install_deps` or `git clone https://github.com/jgrennison/nml`.

Afterwards, run `just` in your terminal. Do be in mind that the commands in listed in `Justfile` can be executed separately, and `just` isn't required to build the GRF.
