# WenSim's Eyecandy Signals

A GRF that adds eyecandy objects as signals.

## Building

This GRF requires [JGR's patched version of NML](https://github.com/jgrennison/nml).
You can download it either via `just install_deps` or `git clone https://github.com/jgrennison/nml`.

Afterwards, run `just` in your terminal.
Do be in mind that the commands in listed in `Justfile` can be executed separately,
and `just` isn't required to build the GRF (but recommended).
